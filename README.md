# MMS - Client side
This repository contains the Client side code of my Full-Stack Maintenance Management System project that utilises Next JS, Typescript, and Tailwind CSS.

For those unfamiliar with the layout of Next JS pages contains all the main files that are rendered when a route is selected, for example:
|File| URL|
|-|-|
|`pages/jobs/index.tsx` | `/jobs`|
|`pages/spares/sparesManagement/[sparesId].tsx` | `/spares/sparesmanagement/1`|

The Components folder houses all of the files and components that are not renderable routes.
